### Section 1

#### Part A.

Equivalent statements to "The cube of a negative number is negative":

All cubes of negative numbers are negative

The cube of a negative integer is negative. The negative statement:
There exists a positive cube whose value is negative.


#### Part C.

Problem statement: "There is one and only one real solution to the equation x^3 + x + 1 = 0"

Here is the negation:

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\forall x \in \mathbb{R} ((p(x) \neq 0) \lor (\exists y \in \mathbb{R}, (p(y)=0) \land (x \neq y))) " />

The negation read in english "There are no real solutions to p(x) = 0 or there exists at least 2 real solutions to p(x) = 0."

See Corrections at the bottom for more info.

### Section 2

Here's how I like to think of for all and there exists and what to do when you
read them in a chained fashion.

Think of for all as being able to choose anything, think of there exists as being to choose (at least) one.

Doing an example might make this more clear:

#### Part C.

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\forall x \exists y P(x,y)" />

What this says is you can choose any x, then choose a particular y. You can also rephrase this to
if you choose any x, you are guaranteed at least one y where the proposition is true

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\exists y \forall x P(x,y)" />

What this says is there is one particular y, such that you can choose any x and the statement will be true.

Notice how these 2 quantifier combinations are different.


#### Part D.
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\exists x \forall y P(x,y)" />

What this says is there is at least one x, such that you can choose any y, and
P(x,y) would be true.


<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\forall y \exists x P(x,y)" />

What this says is for any y, you can be certain that there is at least one x
such that the statement is true.

These 2 statements are the same. The left side says if you choose the right x value,
it doesn't matter what you pick for y. Where as the right side says, it doesn't matter
which y value you choose, so long as pick the right x value.


*I have a column explanation for this, I'll see if I can have it uploaded in the near future*


### Corrections

#### 1c

In class I might have claimed this solution was correct:

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\exists x \in \mathbb{R} ((p(x) = 0) \land (\forall y \in \mathbb{R}, (x \neq y) \land (p(y) \neq 0))) " />

This is wrong; the last and should be an implies, like this.

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\exists x \in \mathbb{R} ((p(x) = 0) \land (\forall y \in \mathbb{R}, (x \neq y) \implies (p(y) \neq 0))) " />

Reason why: the last half <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?(\forall y \in \mathbb{R}, (x \neq y) \land (p(y) \neq 0)) " /> means to say that
the solution to p(x) = 0 is unique, or put in other words "all other real numbers that are not x, the solution to p(x) = 0, will not produce 0 (when y is an input to function p)". However, when we quantify over all reals, we have to be careful, since there is a case when y = x, and in that case, p(y) will produce 0. In
order to exclude that case we use an implies.

The proposition must hold true always and not have a false case, since logical statements are either always true or always false.
