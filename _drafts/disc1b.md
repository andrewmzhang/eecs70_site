### Agenda

1. Ways to prove things
  1. Direct proof
    - To prove P -> Q, assume P, then show Q
  2. Contraposition
    - To prove p -> Q, assume not Q, show not P.
    - Not Q -> not P, is equivalent to P -> Q.
  3. Contradiction
    - To prove P
    - Assume not P, then R, then not R.
    - not P -> not R and R, which is always false
    - If not P is always false, then P must be always true.
    - Thus P.
  4. Proof by cases.
2. Pidgeonhole Principle
  1. If there are N pidgeons, and K pidgeonholes. If N >= K, then
  each pidgeonhole has at least 1 pidgeon.
